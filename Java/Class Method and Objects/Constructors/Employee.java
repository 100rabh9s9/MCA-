/*Write a java program which creates a class Person with the instance variable name and method getName() to return the name. 
 * The class should have a parameterised constructor which takes name as the argument and assign it in the instance variable. 
 * Derive a class Employee from the class Person and the derived class should have an instance variable id.
 * The class should have a method getId() to return the id and a parameterised constructor which takes id and name
 *  as the parameters to assign the values in the corresponding instance variables of the classes using its constructors.
 *  Display the assigned values using the getName() and getId()Â methods.
