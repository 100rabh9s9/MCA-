Constructors are similar to methods where Methods  do not need to match the class name.
Methods can be inherited by subclasses.
Constructors : 
They have Same name as Class and have no return Type 
Constructors are invoked implicitly when an object is created using the new keyword. 
If no constructor is explicitly defined in a class, the Java compiler provides a default, no-argument constructor.
WE have two Types of Constructors :
Default Constructors and Parameterized Constructors
